# TODO

* ~~Implement a video player for youtube videos~~
    * NOTE: Videos with certain copyright restrictions will not play (i.e. sports highlights)
* Allow for saving/loading mindmaps locally
* ~~Put most things into components instead of cramming it in one app.tsx file~~
* Allow for recording audio and being able to play it from a node
* Connect nodes via lines (this is gonna take a bit)
* ~~Replace the current node adding system with a popup that appears when you click anywhere on the canvas~~
* Instad of cramming edit features as part of the node, have it so that clicking on a node will allow you to make edits (IN PROGRESS)
* Make it look prettier
* An about section that informs the user on how to use the mind map
